\usage{
DetermineInteractionTypeOfPath(network, nodesInPath)
}
\arguments{
\item{network}{an igraph representing the network}

\item{nodesInPath}{an ordered list of the nodes visited on the path - note that these contain numbers which use 
R's internal reference to the edges}
}
\value{
a signed integer representing the paths sign
}
\description{
Determines the sign of a given path.
