the information about the network Load in .sif file}
}
\value{
a CG network
}
\description{

Takes in a .sif file output from Cytoscape, and creates an 'igraph' representing the network.
The edges will be annotated with the type of interaction and a weight (1 for activation and -1 for inhibition)

\examples{
# get path to example .sif file
network <- system.file(package="CausalR", "extdata", "testNetwork.sif")
#create cg
cg = CreateCG(network)
